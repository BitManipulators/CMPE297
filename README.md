   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```

3. **Get dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/aishwaryamurahari/Documents/study/CMPE297/SurvivalEdge
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the app**:
   ```bash

## Current Features

- ✅ WhatsApp-style chat UI (custom implementation)
- ✅ Text input with send button
- ✅ Voice input (speech-to-text)
- ✅ Camera and gallery image input
- ✅ Mock response system
- ✅ Offline-first data persistence
- ✅ Permission handling

## Next Steps

This scaffold is ready for:
- Integration with Gemma 3N for local AI inference
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for plant recognition
- Enhanced survival guidance responses
- Image analysis and plant identification

## Dependencies

- `image_picker` - Camera and gallery access
- `speech_to_text` - Voice input
- `flutter_tts` - Text-to-speech (ready for future use)
- `permission_handler` - Runtime permissions
- `path_provider` - File system access

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Flutter not found**: Add Flutter to your PATH
   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/flutter/bin"
   ```

2. **Permission denied**: Ensure all required permissions are granted in Android settings

3. **Build errors**: Run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get`

4. **Dependencies issues**: Check that all packages are compatible with your Flutter version
